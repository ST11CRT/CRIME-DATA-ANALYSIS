The dataset is about the crime rate in the UK and has records from 2013 to 2023.
We received the dataset in odf format, hence the Conversion_to_CSV.ipynb file. I converted the odf to csv using python. It could have been done through a shorter process (through Ms Excel). But I choose to do it differently.
After merging the csv files, there were almost 300K records that needed to be dealt with.
